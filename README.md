# EMS-Group-Project

## Description: 
This program works as an employee management system for a company. It contains functionality to allow users to add employees, update an employeeâ€™s information, remove a particular employee and list employee information. The user information (U/I) is the terminal console where the program prints the information to the user and accepts input from the user's standard input (keyboard). 

Our team utilized various things to complete this program including:
- Principles of OOP to design modularized code that breaks down methods and classes with separation of concerns
- File methods to read and write data to a JSON file
- Adding custom exceptions and exceptionx handling
- List comprehension 
- Git practices to implement version control
